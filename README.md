# SecretSanta
Very simple Python script to draw Secret Santa names for friends and family

It prompts for the names, asks whether someone should not be combined with somebody elso and
generates text files for each person containing the name the person should be buying a present for. 
This is saved in txt format in the SecretSanta folder.

Have fun!
